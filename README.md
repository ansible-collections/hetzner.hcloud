# Ansible Collection: hetzner.hcloud

Ansible Hetzner Cloud Collection for controlling your Hetzner Cloud Resources.

For more information about communication, see the [Ansible communication guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html).

## Python version compatibility

This collection depends on the [hcloud](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-python) library. Due to the [hcloud](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-python) Python Support Policy this collection requires Python 3.10 or greater.

## Release notes

See [here](https://github.com/ansible-collections/hetzner.hcloud/tree/master/CHANGELOG.rst).

### Release policy

The `main` branch is used for the development of the latest versions of the collections, and may contain breaking changes. The `stable-*` branches (e.g. `stable-1` for the `1.x.y` releases) are used to cut additional minor or patch releases if needed, but we do not provide official support for multiple versions of the collection.

## Documentation

The documentation for all modules are available through `ansible-doc`.

Sample: `ansible-doc hetzner.hcloud.server` shows the documentation for the `server` module.

For all modules that were part of Ansible directly (before Ansible 2.11) we also have the documentation published in the
Ansible documentation: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/hetzner/hcloud/

# Development

## Requirements

You should place the collection (clone the repository) into the Ansible collection path. Normally this
is `~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/<namespace>/<collection`, so for our collection it would
be: `~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/hetzner/hcloud`.

```
git clone git@github.com:ansible-collections/hetzner.hcloud.git ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/hetzner/hcloud
```

After this you just need `ansible` installed.

## Testing

Testing is done via `ansible-test`. Make sure to have a `cloud-config-hcloud.ini` file in `tests/integration` which
contains the hcloud API token:

```
[default]
hcloud_api_token=<token>
```

After this you should be able to use `ansible-test integration` to perform the integration tests for a specific module.
Sample:

```
ansible-test integration --color --local -vvv hetzner.hcloud.server // Executed all integration tests for server module
```

## Releasing a new version

If there are releasable changes, `release-please` will open a PR on GitHub with the proposed version. When this PR is merged, `release-please` will tag the release.

## Releasing experimental features

To publish experimental features as part of regular releases:

- an announcement, including a link to a changelog entry, must be added to the release notes.

- an `Experimental` notice, including a link to a changelog entry, must be added to the experimental plugins documentation:

  ```py
  DOCUMENTATION = """
  ---
  module: product

  description:
      - Create, update and manage Product on the Hetzner Cloud.
      - B(Experimental:) $PRODUCT is $MATURITY, breaking changes may occur within minor releases. See https://docs.hetzner.cloud/changelog#$SLUG for more details.
  """
  ```

- a `Experimental` warning, including a link to a changelog entry, must be logged when experimental plugins are being used:

  ```py
  product_experimental_warning = experimental_warning_function(
      "$PRODUCT",
      "$MATURITY",
      "https://docs.hetzner.cloud/changelog#$SLUG",
  )

  class AnsibleProduct(AnsibleHCloud):
      def __init__(self, module: AnsibleModule):
          product_experimental_warning(module)
          super().__init__(module)
  ```
