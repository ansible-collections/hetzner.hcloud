release_summary: |
  This release is phasing out datacenters in ``Primary IPs`` and ``Servers``.

  We added a new ``location`` property to the request body and response of ``Servers`` and ``Primary IPs``.
  The same data was previously present under ``datacenter.location``.

  We deprecated the ``datacenter`` property in the request body and response of ``Servers`` and ``Primary IPs``.
  The removal will happen after 1 July 2026.

  See our `changelog`_ for more details.
