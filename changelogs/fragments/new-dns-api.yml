release_summary: |
  This release adds support for the new `DNS API`_.

  The DNS API is currently in **beta**, which will likely end on 10
  November 2025. After the beta ended, it will no longer be possible to
  create new zones in the old DNS system. See the `DNS Beta FAQ`_ for more
  details.

  Future minor releases of this project may include breaking changes for
  features that are related to the DNS API.

  See the `DNS API Beta changelog`_ for more details.
